If you are doing this on purpose, you may safely ignore this warning. Otherwise, make sure you are not losing information, leading to unexpected circuit behavior.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 16-bit latch for signal <M_show>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
